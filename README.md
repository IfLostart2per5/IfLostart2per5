Hello! My name is Alexandre Barreto, I'm 15 years old, I study math, programming and compilers. Simple. But in some situations I can learn other fields too.

## My stack
Currently, I work with these languages:
1. Lua (greater-than-married)
2. C++/C

But I know other languages:

1. Python
2. Rust
3. JS (basic)
4. HTML and CSS (very basic)
5. Assembly x64 (I need help working with this)

okay. Well, talking about other topics, I'm learning physics now. Maybe there will be some games ...
Bye!
